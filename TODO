recommend: for database schema it may be useful to have a "upload time" for administration and a "dates of operation" for searchable camps between certain dates?

TODO:

Search page on database

investigate searching by distance from address/zipcode (ie: "within 10 miles of your location there are x camps")

login page
    for user login https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/using-amazon-cognito-for-secure-login-to-your-web-app 
    amazon cognito could be used?

upload page for listings

account ID on upload page should not exist, should pull from user account instead

Make a header for navigation
