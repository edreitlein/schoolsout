    DESIGN: Implement better css design conventions and better PHP reuse of variables

            PHP: use variables to reuse code such as for regex
                possibly -> foreach in $_POST for campupload



    INVESTIGATE: A possible rewrite with laravel or cakephp



===========================
            OLD
===========================


Search page on database

investigate searching by distance from address/zipcode (ie: "within 10 miles of your location there are x camps")

login page
    for user login https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/using-amazon-cognito-for-secure-login-to-your-web-app 
    amazon cognito could be used?

upload page for listings

account ID on upload page should not exist, should pull from user account instead

Make a header for navigation





1. For administrative purposes, "Upload Time/Upload Date" may be a useful piece of information to collect. --I agree.
2. To improve search functionality, it may be useful for camps to specify which dates they are in operation. (example: Camp opens: June 15, Closes: August 15).--Yes, the first day and last day of camp would be very useful.
3. Should the camps also list the days of the week they are open when uploading to the website?-YES


To add as well, we need a day camp/overnight camp delineation.  A user could be searching for one (or both) of these options.


Section for when (date) the camp fills up
Ideally, we have this filled in when the camp is uploaded or shortly thereafter and then update it when (if) the camp fills so the information is accurate for the following year.

camp listing editor

orgnaize TODO and add rest of fields for DB


make individual pages that are clickable for camp entries : ie from listing -> click listing -> go to page that has more info

NULL zipcodes present issues, should we make them a required field or just autopopulate them with 00000?

add DB entry for when camp fills up

finish camp upload data validation
